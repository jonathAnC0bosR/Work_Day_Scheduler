# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is the Work Day Scheduler repo. The project was made with jQuery javascript, bootstrap and HTML. I used the dayjs() library to be able to display the time in the document. I learned how to get the id of an element with .split() and how the local storage works, but mainly how bootstrap css works and how jQuery javascript works. 

## Usage

As a busy person you want to wrap all your activities inside a page where you can find it everytime you want. Also you want to be displayed according to the current time, a color when it is past time, another when it is present and another when it is future.
